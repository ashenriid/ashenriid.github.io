<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Summer broke on the backs of childen,<br />even though swings performed miracles<br />and breezes sang psalms</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">For that summer, from the outskirts<br />of some far off even whimsical place<br />came the low resolute moo of a dragon.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">A child, of course, could not recognize that fabled moo<br />or the serpentine taile close to her feet,<br />wound up amond the thistle and milkweed<br />like a hose.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Nor for that matter could she recognize<br />the starry white bone left upright in the sandbox<br />like some remarkable claw<br />or shovel.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Not when the sun was out and games continued.<br />Certainly not when there was summer love<br />and rotbeer.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">But at dusk when the fog crept in,<br />thick and sweating,<br />suggesting some kind of burning far off,<br />down over there,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">(where someone once saw two eyes</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">- pale as October moons -</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">blink)</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">a child could know the meaning<br />of fall.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">And that August, two weeks before school began,<br />some children went down to that place</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">and they never came back</p>
